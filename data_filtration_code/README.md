## Data Filtration 
We use a two step data filtration for our bilingual dataset. 

 1. Primary Filtration
 2. Secondary Filtration

Both the notebooks are provided in this folder. Since the codes were developed independently, we are providing the requirements.txt file containing all the module versions to successfully run the notebook.

Please use the following code to install the required modules.

    pip install -r <NAME OF requirements.txt FILE YOU ARE USING>
